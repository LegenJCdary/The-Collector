# The Collector
Every music lover's wet dream.

## Features
* Collection - create ultimate music collection on your personal device using sqlite db, web search and manual inputs. Include as much info as is possible and interesting to user.
* Mapping - map tracks to specific album versions (e.g. 19XX Hungarian LP bonus track vs 2XXX remaster) or even (unmixed) DJ sets (ID - ID no more; mash-ups gonna be a challenge).
* Sync - run (periodically or manually) synchronizations of your playlists between supported platforms: yt, spotify, soundcloud, mixcloud ??, Apple Music (f.k.a iTunes)?.
* Master Player - allows you to stream music from different platforms with smooth reloads and no delay, allowing...
* Master Playlist - no more playlists scattered over different platforms and no more mental-stubbing tracks that are oh-so-perfect-for-this-playlist-wish-it-was-on-Spotify

## Over-the-top features
* Encyclopaedia Musica ?? (online db, metal-archives.com version 2.0) - an online version of the existing db scheme, that you can sync and compare your private collection to (perhaps even gain some community respect e.g. badges). Would require a collaborative space and tool-set for artists, experts and users to create and verify submissions. Would require tedious maintenance that only hardly sleeping, ocd-fueled audiophiles can provide.
* AtoMix ?? (AI) - recreate actual DJ sets, home sets and live performances in your collection. Sound recognition model (with some algorithm) matches tracks to "source" version (Studio version/Original mix), finds mix-in/mix-out timestamps in the source set and saves it to your db as a playlist. Using Master Play(er/list) functionalities and built-in (AI?) fader/mixer, the original set can be successfully reconstructed with "source" music. Now you can take this set and remove some pesky slow-down-dubstep-part-taken-from-no-name-remix.
